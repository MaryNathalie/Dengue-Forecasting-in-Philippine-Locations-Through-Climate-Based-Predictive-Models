Dengue fever remains a significant public health concern in the Philippines, with outbreaks driven by complex climatological and environmental factors. This project explores **predictive modeling techniques** using **time series analysis** and **machine learning** to forecast dengue cases in **Bulacan, Quezon City, and Rizal**‚Äîareas identified within the same dengue case cluster.

The project integrates climate variables, historical dengue case trends, and statistical models such as **SARIMAX**, alongside machine learning approaches like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor** to improve forecasting accuracy.

## üéØ Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for **dengue cases** using climatological and time-series data.
- Analyze the impact of **climate factors** on dengue incidence.
- Compare traditional statistical models **(SARIMA, SARIMAX)** with **machine learning models**.
- Identify potential **outbreak periods** for proactive health interventions.

</p> 

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Temporal Alignment:** Aggregated daily climate data to match dengue case granularity.
- **Data Imputation:** Forward Fill Imputation.
- **Location Clustering:** t-SNE Dimensionality Reduction and K-Means Clustering based on dengue cases and climate patterns.

</p> 

- **Stationarity Check:** Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test to ensuring data stability for time series modeling.

<div align="center">
  
| Location     | Test Statistic | p-value  | Stationary? |
|--------------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| Bulacan      | -4.6872        | 8.89e-5  | ‚úÖ Yes      |
| Quezon City  | -3.8470        | 0.0025   | ‚úÖ Yes      |
| Rizal        | -3.9619        | 0.0016   | ‚úÖ Yes      |

</div>

### 2. Feature Processing
  - **Temporal Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Ordinally encoded day, month, and year from the date, calculated lagged 4-week moving averages and applied Fourier series transformations.
  - **Geographical Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Added latitude, longitude, and location label features.
  - **Anomaly Detection** ‚Äì Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN).

</p> 

  - **Climate Feature Selection** ‚Äì Selected based on their relevance to environmental factors‚Äìsolar radiation (Group 1), cloud cover (Group 2), hydrological variables (Group 3), temperature (Group 4), and wind speed (Group 5).
  - **Univariate Correlation Check** ‚Äì Remove highly correlated features chec with Pearson Univariate Correlation Analysis.

</p> 

  - **Temporal Splitting and Time Series Cross-Validation** ‚Äì 70% of the data (January 10, 2016, to July 14, 2019) was for training. 30% of the data (July 21, 2019, to January 10, 2021) was for testing. 

### 3. Model Training
- **Statistical Models:** (Optimized with Auto-ARIMA) SARIMA, SARIMAX.
- **Machine Learning Models:** (Selected with TPOT and optimized with Optuna) SGD Regressor, XGBoost.
- **Validation:** Time-series cross-validation (70% training, 30% testing).

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average prediction error.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Penalizes large errors.
- **R¬≤ Score:** Indicates model fit and predictive power.

### 5. Outbreak Prediction
- Detected unexpected dengue case surges based on a moving average threshold defined by the [WHO technical handbook for dengue surveillace](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549738). 

## üìä Results

### Dengue Incidence Prediction 
<div align="center">

| Model          | MAE    | RMSE   | R-squared |
|----------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| SARIMA         | 130.87 | 175.85 | -5.14%    |
| SARIMAX        | 77.37  | 89.36  | 73.14%    |
| XGBoost        | 58.48  | 91.08  | 71.93%    |
| SGDRegressor   | **32.26**  | **59.32**  | **83.40%**    |

</div>

- **SGDRegressor achieved the best performance** with the lowest error and highest accuracy.  
- Compared to **SARIMA** that performed poorly, **SARIMAX** performed well due to the inclusion of exogenous variables.  
- **XGBoost overfitted** and failed to predict sudden spikes accurately.

### Dengue Outbreak Prediction 

## üîç Key Insights & Future Work
