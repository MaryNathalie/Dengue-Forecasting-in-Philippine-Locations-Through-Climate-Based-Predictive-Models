Dengue fever remains a significant public health concern in the Philippines, with outbreaks driven by complex climatological and environmental factors. This project explores **predictive modeling techniques** using **time series analysis** and **machine learning** to forecast dengue cases in **Bulacan, Quezon City, and Rizal**‚Äîareas identified within the same dengue case cluster.

The project integrates climate variables, historical dengue case trends, and statistical models such as **SARIMAX**, alongside machine learning approaches like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor** to improve forecasting accuracy.

## üéØ Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for **dengue cases** using climatological and time-series data.
- Analyze the impact of **climate factors** on dengue incidence.
- Compare traditional statistical models **(SARIMA, SARIMAX)** with **machine learning models**.
- Identify potential **outbreak periods** for proactive health interventions.

### 2. Feature Processing
  - Temporal Feature Engineering ‚Äì Creating lagged variables, Fourier transformations, etc.
  - Geographical Feature Engineering ‚Äì Adding latitude, longitude, and location-based features.
  - Anomaly Detection ‚Äì Identifying outliers using DBSCAN.
  - Climate Feature Selection ‚Äì Choosing the most relevant meteorological variables.
  - Univariate Correlation Check ‚Äì Reducing multicollinearity.
  - Temporal Splitting and Time Series Cross-Validation ‚Äì Ensuring proper model evaluation.

### 3. Model Training
- **Statistical Models:** SARIMA, SARIMAX (Auto-ARIMA tuning).
- **Machine Learning Models:** SGD Regressor, XGBoost (optimized via Optuna and TPOT).
- **Validation:** Time-series cross-validation (70% training, 30% testing).

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average prediction error.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Penalizes large errors.
- **R¬≤ Score:** Indicates model fit and predictive power.

### 5. Outbreak Prediction
- Defined based on a moving average threshold, detecting unexpected dengue case surges.

## üìä Results
1. SGD Regressor achieved the best performance with:
- MAE: 32.26
- RMSE: 59.32
- R¬≤ Score: 83.40%
2. The model successfully captured seasonal dengue trends, but struggled with outbreak predictions, indicating a need for further feature engineering.

### üîç Key Insights & Future Work
1. Feature Expansion: Incorporating demographic and urbanization data could enhance accuracy.
2. Deep Learning Approaches: Testing LSTMs, GRUs, and Attention Mechanisms for better sequential modeling.
3. Spatial Dependencies: Exploring how dengue cases in nearby locations influence each other.
